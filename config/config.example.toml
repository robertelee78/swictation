# Voice Activity Detection threshold
#
# Controls sensitivity for detecting speech vs noise.
# Valid range: 0.0 to 1.0
#
# - 0.0 = Most sensitive (detects everything as speech, many false positives)
# - 0.5 = Balanced (recommended default)
# - 1.0 = Most conservative (only very confident speech, may miss quiet speech)
#
# Tuning guide:
# - If missing soft speech or quiet words: Lower to 0.3-0.4
# - If triggering on background noise: Raise to 0.6-0.7
#
threshold = 0.5

# Silence duration threshold (seconds)
#
# How long to wait after you stop speaking before processing the text.
# This is the "pause" you experience before text appears.
# Valid range: 0.3 to 10.0
#
# - 0.3 = Minimum (very fast response, may cut off sentences)
# - 2.0 = Balanced (recommended default, natural pause length)
# - 3.0 = Slower but captures more complete thoughts
#
# Tuning guide:
# - If sentences getting cut off mid-thought: Increase to 2.5-3.0
# - If waiting too long for text to appear: Decrease to 1.0-1.5
# - For rapid-fire dictation: Try 0.5-1.0
