# Swictation QT Tray Requirements
# ================================
# Minimal Python dependencies for QT tray launcher on Sway/Wayland
#
# IMPORTANT: This is ONLY needed for Sway/Wayland users!
# - NPM package users: No Python needed (includes pre-compiled Rust binaries)
# - Windows/macOS users: No Python needed (Tauri tray works natively)
# - Most Linux users: No Python needed (Tauri tray works on GNOME, KDE, etc.)
# - Sway/Wayland users: Need this for tray icon compatibility workaround
#
# Installation for Sway/Wayland users only:
#   pip3 install -r requirements-qt-tray.txt
#
# System packages may be required:
#   Ubuntu/Debian: apt install python3-pyside6
#   Fedora: dnf install python3-pyside6
#   Arch: pacman -S pyside6

# QT Framework for system tray icon (Sway/Wayland workaround)
