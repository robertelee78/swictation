# Parakeet-TDT Transcription Patterns

**Model:** NVIDIA Parakeet-TDT-1.1B
**Date Documented:** November 12, 2025
**Source:** Real-world transcription logs from running daemon
**Status:** ✅ VAD Fixed and Operational

---

## Executive Summary

Parakeet-TDT transcribes speech **literally** without interpreting voice commands as punctuation or symbols. This is the foundation for building a secretary-style dictation transformation layer.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Voice commands transcribed as words (e.g., "comma" → "comma", not ",")
- ✅ All text lowercase, including "I" → "i"
- ✅ No automatic punctuation added
- ✅ Numbers transcribed as words (e.g., "nineteen fifty" not "1950")
- ✅ Clean, accurate text output requiring post-processing for symbols

---

## 1. Voice Command Handling

### Punctuation Commands (Transcribed Literally)

The model transcribes punctuation voice commands as **plain text**, not symbols:

| Voice Command | Parakeet Output | Symbol Needed |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| "comma" | `comma` | `,` |
| "period" | `period` | `.` |
| "question mark" | `question mark` | `?` |
| "exclamation point" | `exclamation point` | `!` |
| "semicolon" | `semicolon` | `;` |
| "colon" | `colon` | `:` |

**Example from logs:**
```
Input speech:  "we might want to enable something like percent sign comma"
Transcribed:   "we might want to enable something like percent sign comma"
Expected:      "we might want to enable something like % sign,"
```

### Bracket/Parenthesis Commands

| Voice Command | Parakeet Output | Symbol Needed |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| "open parenthesis" | `open parenthesis` | `(` |
| "close parenthesis" | `close parenthesis` | `)` |
| "close parentheses" | `close parentheses` | `)` |
| "open bracket" | `open bracket` | `[` |
| "close bracket" | `close bracket` | `]` |
| "open brace" | `open brace` | `{` |
| "close brace" | `close brace` | `}` |

**Example from logs:**
```
Input speech:  "need to be able to accommodate open parenthesis and close parentheses"
Transcribed:   "need to be able to accommodate open parenthesis and close parentheses"
Expected:      "need to be able to accommodate ( and )"
```

### Quote Commands

| Voice Command | Parakeet Output | Symbol Needed |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| "open quote" | `open quote` | `"` |
| "close quote" | `close quote` | `"` |
| "single quote" | `single quote` | `'` |
| "apostrophe" | `apostrophe` | `'` |

**Example from logs:**
```
Input speech:  "open quote and close quote"
Transcribed:   "open quote and close quote"
Expected:      "" and ""
```

### Special Symbol Commands

| Voice Command | Parakeet Output | Symbol Needed |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| "dollar sign" | `dollar sign` | `$` |
| "percent sign" | `percent sign` | `%` |
| "percent" | `percent` | `%` |
| "at sign" | `at sign` | `@` |
| "ampersand" | `ampersand` | `&` |
| "asterisk" | `asterisk` | `*` |
| "hash" / "hashtag" | `hash` / `hashtag` | `#` |

**Example from logs:**
```
Input speech:  "special symbols like dollar sign"
Transcribed:   "special symbols like dollar sign"
Expected:      "special symbols like $"
```

---

## 2. Capitalization Behavior

### All Lowercase Output

Parakeet-TDT outputs **all lowercase text**, regardless of context:

| Input Speech | Parakeet Output | Expected Output |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Hello world" | `hello world` | `Hello world` |
| "I'm curious" | `i'm curious` | `I'm curious` |
| "New York City" | `new york city` | `New York City` |

**Example from logs:**
```
Input speech:  "I'm curious what other things you might imagine we could use"
Transcribed:   "i'm curious what other things you might imagine we could use"
Expected:      "I'm curious what other things you might imagine we could use"
```

### No Sentence-Start Capitalization

The model does **not** automatically capitalize the first word of sentences:

```
Input:  "Hello world. Testing one two three."
Output: "hello world testing one two three"
```

### Proper Nouns

Even proper nouns are lowercase:

```
Input:  "My name is Robert Lee"
Output: "my name is robert lee"
```

**Implication:** Post-processing transformation layer must handle:
- First-person pronoun capitalization ("i" → "I")
- Sentence-start capitalization
- Proper noun detection (optional, complex)

---

## 3. Punctuation Behavior

### No Automatic Punctuation

The model does **not** add any punctuation automatically:

- ✅ No trailing periods
- ✅ No commas for pauses
- ✅ No question marks for rising intonation
- ✅ Clean text requiring explicit voice commands for symbols

**Example:**
```
Input speech:  "Hello world [pause] Testing one two three"
Transcribed:   "hello world testing one two three"
Expected:      "Hello world. Testing one two three."
```

### Pause Handling

VAD-detected pauses (0.8s silence) trigger segment transcription, but no punctuation is added:

```
Segment 1: "hello world"       [0.8s pause detected]
Segment 2: "testing one two three"

No punctuation between segments - requires voice commands or transformation rules
```

---

## 4. Number Handling

### Numbers as Words

Numbers are transcribed as words, not digits:

| Input Speech | Parakeet Output | Desired Output |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| "nineteen fifty" | `nineteen fifty` | `1950` |
| "one two three" | `one two three` | `1, 2, 3` or `one two three` |
| "twenty twenty five" | `twenty twenty five` | `2025` |

**Example from logs:**
```
Input speech:  "in the theme of nineteen fifty secretary style"
Transcribed:   "in the theme of nineteen fifty secretary style"
Expected:      "in the theme of 1950 secretary style"
```

**Note:** This is actually desirable for dictation - allows "one two three" to remain as words when needed, and explicit "number mode" for digits.

---

## 5. Real-World Examples from Production Logs

### Example 1: Voice Command Description
```
Input:  "please give me a one line description for each of the terms of noun pronoun proper noun"
Output: "please give me a one line description for each of the terms of noun pronoun proper noun"
```
**Analysis:** Clean transcription, all lowercase, no punctuation

### Example 2: Symbol Commands
```
Input:  "need to be able to accommodate open parenthesis and close parentheses"
Output: "need to be able to accommodate open parenthesis and close parentheses"
```
**Analysis:** Voice commands transcribed literally, awaiting transformation

### Example 3: Mixed Content
```
Input:  "we might want to enable something like percent sign comma"
Output: "we might want to enable something like percent sign comma"
```
**Analysis:** Multiple voice commands in one sentence, all literal

### Example 4: Contractions
```
Input:  "i'm curious what other things you might imagine we could use"
Output: "i'm curious what other things you might imagine we could use"
```
**Analysis:** Contractions preserved, "i'm" lowercase (not "I'm")

## 6. Transformation Requirements

Based on these patterns, the MidStream transformation layer needs:

### Priority 1: Basic Punctuation (Essential)
```rust
"comma"          → ","
"period"         → "."
"question mark"  → "?"
"exclamation"    → "!"
"colon"          → ":"
"semicolon"      → ";"
```

### Priority 2: Brackets & Quotes
```rust
"open paren"     → "("
"close paren"    → ")"
"open bracket"   → "["
"close bracket"  → "]"
"open brace"     → "{"
"close brace"    → "}"
"quote"          → "\""
"apostrophe"     → "'"
```

### Priority 3: Symbols
```rust
"dollar sign"    → "$"
"percent"        → "%"
"at sign"        → "@"
"ampersand"      → "&"
"asterisk"       → "*"
"hash"           → "#"
```

### Priority 4: Capitalization Rules
```rust
"i'm" → "I'm"
"i'd" → "I'd"
"i'll" → "I'll"
"i" (standalone) → "I"
[sentence start] → capitalize first letter
```

### Priority 5: Special Commands
```rust
"new line"       → "\n"
"new paragraph"  → "\n\n"
"tab"            → "\t"
"caps on/off"    → [capitalize mode]
"all caps"       → [UPPERCASE mode]
```

## 7. Model Comparison: 0.6B vs 1.1B

### ⚠️ CRITICAL DIFFERENCE: Inference Backend Behavior

**The two Parakeet-TDT models behave COMPLETELY differently** due to their inference backends:

| Model | Backend | Capitalization | Punctuation | Secretary Mode Compatible |
|-------|---------|----------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **1.1B INT8** | Direct ONNX Runtime | ❌ None (all lowercase) | ❌ None | ✅ Yes (raw output) |
| **0.6B** | Sherpa-RS | ✅ Auto-added | ✅ Auto-added | ⚠️ Requires stripping |

### 1.1B Model (Direct ONNX Runtime)

**Test Input:** "Hello world. Testing, one, two, three."

**Acoustic Loop Results:**
```
Raw STT Output:   "low world"  (lowercase, no punctuation)
After Transform:  "Low world"  (Secretary Mode + capitalization)

Raw STT Output:   "testing one two three"
After Transform:  "Testing 1 2 3"  (number transformation working)
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Outputs pure lowercase text
- ✅ No automatic punctuation
- ✅ No automatic capitalization
- ✅ Perfect for Secretary Mode (1950s dictation)
- ✅ Numbers as words ("one two three")
- ✅ Behavior matches documentation

### 0.6B Model (Sherpa-RS)

**Test Input:** Same audio file

**Acoustic Loop Results:**
```
Raw STT Output:   "Low world. Testing. One, two, three."
                  ^^^       ^         ^^^^ ^^^  ^^^  ^^^^
                  Capitalized + Auto-punctuation added!
```

**Characteristics:**
- ⚠️ Auto-capitalizes first letters
- ⚠️ Auto-adds periods, commas
- ⚠️ Capitalizes numbers ("One" not "one")
- ❌ Breaks Secretary Mode without preprocessing
- ⚠️ Post-processing added by sherpa-rs library

**Secretary Mode Problem:**
```
User says:        "hello comma world period"
Sherpa-RS outputs: "Hello, comma world period."  (auto-comma after Hello!)
Transform adds:    "Hello,, world period."       (double comma!)
```

### Fix: Punctuation Stripping (v0.4.2+)

The daemon now strips auto-added formatting before Secretary Mode:

```rust
let cleaned_text = text
    .to_lowercase()          // Remove auto-capitalization
    .replace(",", "")        // Remove auto-commas
    .replace(".", "")        // Remove auto-periods
    .replace("?", "")        // etc...
```

This normalizes both models to lowercase + no punctuation before transformation.

### Recommendation

**For Secretary Mode:**
- ✅ **1.1B Model Preferred** - Native raw output, no preprocessing needed
- ⚠️ **0.6B Model OK** - Works with v0.4.2+ stripping fix

**For Standard Dictation:**
- ✅ **0.6B Model** - Auto-formatting saves post-processing
- ⚠️ **1.1B Model** - Requires capitalization pipeline

## 8. Differences from Other Models

### vs. Dragon NaturallySpeaking
- **Dragon:** Auto-capitalizes sentences, inserts punctuation heuristically
- **Parakeet 1.1B:** Literal transcription, no automatic formatting
- **Parakeet 0.6B:** Similar to Dragon (auto-formatting via sherpa-rs)

### vs. Whisper
- **Whisper:** May add some punctuation, varies by model size
- **Parakeet 1.1B:** Consistent literal behavior, no punctuation
- **Parakeet 0.6B:** Adds punctuation/capitalization (sherpa-rs post-processing)

### vs. Canary-1B
- **Comparison needed:** Task documented but not yet tested side-by-side

## 10. Implementation Recommendations

### Secretary Dictation Mode Strategy

**Phase 1: Core Punctuation (Week 1)**
- Implement top 10 most common commands
- "comma", "period", "question mark", "new line"
- Basic capitalization ("i" → "I")

**Phase 2: Symbols & Brackets (Week 2)**
- Parentheses, brackets, braces
- Quote marks
- Common symbols ($, %, @)

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3+)**
- Sentence-start capitalization
- Mode commands (caps on/off, all caps)
- Number conversion ("nineteen fifty" → "1950")
- Custom vocabulary

### MidStream Integration

The transformation layer should:
1. **Preserve original text** in buffer for undo/correction
2. **Apply rules in order:** capitalization → punctuation → symbols
3. **Support toggling:** dictation mode on/off
4. **Performance target:** <1ms transformation latency (already achieved)

---

## 11. Known Edge Cases

### Ambiguous Commands
- "period" at end of sentence vs. "period" meaning the punctuation
- "quote" meaning quotation mark vs. "quote" as a noun
- **Solution:** Context-aware rules or explicit mode commands

### Homophones
- "two" vs. "to" vs. "too"
- "their" vs. "there" vs. "they're"
- **Model handles well:** Usually correct from context

### Compound Commands
- "comma and then period"
- **Current behavior:** Both transcribed as words
- **Desired:** `, .`

---

## 12. Quirks & Workarounds

### Double Spacing
After VAD segments, text is injected without automatic spacing:
```
Segment 1: "hello world"
Segment 2: "testing"
Result: "hello worldtesting" (no space)
```
**Workaround:** Ensure VAD segments include trailing space, or add space in transformation

### State Management
Voice commands don't persist state between segments:
```
"caps on" [pause] "hello world" [pause] "caps off"
Currently: All separate segments, no state
Needed: State machine in transformation layer
```
