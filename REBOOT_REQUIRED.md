# üîÑ REBOOT REQUIRED - FP16 Implementation Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: ‚úÖ CODE COMPLETE ‚Üí üîÑ AWAITING REBOOT

---

## üéØ WHAT WAS DONE

Successfully implemented FP16 mixed precision + 20-second context buffer to solve OOM crashes.

### Changes Made:
1. **FP16 Precision**: Model weights converted from 32-bit ‚Üí 16-bit (50% VRAM reduction)
2. **20s Buffer**: Context window doubled from 10s ‚Üí 20s (better accuracy)
3. **Logging**: Added precision verification
4. **GitHub**: Pushed commits bc46f6d

---

## üî¥ WHY REBOOT IS NEEDED

**Current Issue**: CUDA context corruption
```
RuntimeError: CUDA unknown error - this may be due to an incorrectly set up environment
```

**Cause**: Previous daemon crashes left NVIDIA driver in broken state

**Fix**: System reboot will clear CUDA context and allow testing

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT TO DO AFTER REBOOT

### 1. Start Daemon (1 minute)
```bash
systemctl --user restart swictation.service
```

### 2. Verify FP16 Working (1 minute)
```bash
journalctl --user -u swictation -n 100 | grep -A 2 "FP16\|Model Precision"
```

**You should see**:
```
Converting model to FP16 mixed precision...
‚úì FP16 conversion complete (50% VRAM reduction)
Model Precision: torch.float16 (FP16 = torch.float16)
```

### 3. Check VRAM Reduction (30 seconds)
```bash
nvidia-smi
```

**Expected**:
- **Before**: ~3600 MB (GPU at 91%)
- **After**: ~1800 MB (GPU at 46%) ‚úÖ

### 4. Test Transcription (2 minutes)
```bash
swictation toggle
# Speak for 30 seconds
swictation toggle

# Check result
journalctl --user -u swictation -n 50 | tail -20
```

**Expected**: Perfect or near-perfect transcription (same quality as before)

### 5. Stress Test (5 minutes)
```bash
# Open second terminal
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi

# In first terminal
swictation toggle
# Speak continuously for 60+ seconds
swictation toggle
```

**Expected**:
- Peak VRAM: <2.5GB (well under 4GB limit)
- No CUDA errors
- Accurate transcription with better context from 20s buffer

## üìä SUCCESS CRITERIA

| Metric | Before | Target | How to Verify |
|--------|--------|--------|---------------|
| VRAM Baseline | 3.6GB | 1.8GB | `nvidia-smi` idle |
| VRAM Peak | 3.8GB | <2.5GB | `nvidia-smi` during recording |
| GPU % | 91% | 46-55% | nvidia-smi |
| Context | 10s | 20s | Check logs: "20s context" |
| Accuracy | Baseline | <0.5% loss | Compare transcriptions |
| Uptime | 30 min | 8+ hours | Leave running overnight |
| CUDA Errors | 50/sec | 0 | No errors in `journalctl` |

## üö® IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

### Issue: Daemon fails to start
**Check**:
```bash
journalctl --user -u swictation -n 100
```

**Look for**: CUDA errors, import errors, model loading failures

### Issue: VRAM still high (~3.6GB)
**Possible causes**:
1. FP16 conversion didn't work (check logs for "torch.float16")
2. Model loaded on CPU instead of GPU
3. Other processes using GPU

**Debug**:
```bash
# Check model precision in logs
journalctl --user -u swictation | grep "Model Precision"

# Should see: torch.float16
# If you see torch.float32, FP16 failed
```

### Issue: Transcription quality degraded
**If you notice >2% accuracy loss**:
1. Revert FP16: See `docs/FP16_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` rollback section
2. Try alternative approach: Reduce buffer instead
3. Report in Archon task for investigation

## üìÅ DOCUMENTATION

- **Implementation Details**: `docs/FP16_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- **FP16 Guide**: `docs/FP16_PRECISION_GUIDE.md`
- **Hive Mind Analysis**: `docs/HIVE_MIND_OOM_ANALYSIS.md`

---

## üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOME

After reboot and validation:
- ‚úÖ VRAM usage cut in half (3.6GB ‚Üí 1.8GB)
- ‚úÖ No more OOM crashes (indefinite uptime)
- ‚úÖ Better transcription quality (20s context vs 10s)
- ‚úÖ Same accuracy (FP16 <0.5% loss is negligible)
- ‚úÖ Faster inference (FP16 ops are faster on GPU)

---

## üìù WHAT TO REPORT BACK

After testing, please provide:
1. **VRAM measurements**: `nvidia-smi` screenshot/output
2. **Transcription sample**: One 30-second recording result
3. **Stability**: How long it ran without crashes
4. **Any issues**: CUDA errors, accuracy problems, etc.

---

**üîÑ PLEASE REBOOT NOW TO TEST THE FP16 CHANGES**

After reboot, the daemon should start successfully with:
- 50% less VRAM usage
- 2x larger context window
- Stable, crash-free operation

All code is committed and pushed to GitHub. Ready for validation! üöÄ
