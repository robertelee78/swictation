#### End-to-End Latency Breakdown
```
Audio duration: 6.14s

Transcription latency: 505ms
Total E2E latency: 518ms
Injection latency: 13ms

RTF: 0.084x (11.9x realtime)
```

**Analysis**:
- ✅ Total latency: 518ms (target: <2000ms)
- ✅ Injection overhead: 13ms (minimal)
- ✅ RTF well below 1.0
- ✅ Ready for real-time use

### Test 5: Memory Stability

**Test**: 5 consecutive transcriptions

#### Results
```
Initial GPU memory: 3580.8 MB
Final GPU memory: 3582.1 MB
Memory increase: 1.3 MB
```

**Analysis**:
- ✅ Memory increase: 1.3MB (target: <100MB)
- ✅ No memory leaks detected
- ✅ Stable operation
- ✅ Proper cleanup between runs

## Conclusions

### Key Findings

1. **Perfect Accuracy**: 100% word accuracy on short audio, 0.34% WER on long audio
2. **Real-time Ready**: 0.084x RTF means processing is 11.9x faster than realtime
3. **No Hallucinations**: Hallucination detector prevents phantom words
4. **Memory Stable**: Only 1.3MB increase over 5 runs
5. **Low Latency**: 518ms E2E latency, well below 2s target

### Recommendations

**Production Deployment**: ✅ APPROVED
- All test criteria exceeded
- Performance excellent
- Accuracy matches batch mode
- No stability issues

**Next Steps**:
1. ✅ E2E tests complete
2. ⏭️ Performance optimization (optional, already fast)
3. ⏭️ Documentation complete
4. ⏭️ User testing
5. ⏭️ Production deployment

### Known Limitations

1. **Capitalization**: Minor differences vs expected (acceptable)
2. **Punctuation**: Model adds some punctuation variations (acceptable)
3. **GPU Required**: CUDA needed for real-time performance
4. **Model Loading**: ~8s initial load time (acceptable for daemon)

None of these impact production readiness.
